libgloss-js
===========
features
--------
- no hard dependencies on other frameworks or libs (not even jquery or node.js required)
- pure strict mode developed and tested
- strictly one type definition per source file
- does not require the HTML5 API although the color space conversion from HSB to RGB makes pixelwise canvas programming a beautiful passion - expect a beautiful demo to join this repo soon!
- *should* work even in IE6
- beautiful code poetry, making it a nice read for humans as well as computers
